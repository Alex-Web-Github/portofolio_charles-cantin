# Project Title: "Portofolio de Charles Cantin, Photographe". 
WP Theme created for an exercise during my formation of Web Developper at Studi-Digital School.
## Theme features:
I began my project with a "boilerplate" for developers only (https://github.com/AlexWebLab/bs5starter).
This is a minimum Bootstrap 5 WordPress starter theme.
* minimum amount of files required for a WordPress theme (index.php and style.css)
* Bootstrap 5 CSS & JS files enqueued (in function.php from /functions/enqueues.php)
* jQuery removed but optionally available commenting out one line from /functions/enqueues.php
* Bootstrap 5 starter template (separated in 3 files: header.php, index.php and footer.php)
* custom wp_nav_menu walker for Bootstrap 5 navbar (in function.php from /functions/navbar.php)
* empty custom.css & custom.js files (located in /css and /js, respectively)
## How to proceed to install this WP theme:
